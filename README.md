# Modeling-buildings-and-their-heating-systems
Introduction
As part of the heat transition, houses all over the world are being renovated and fitted with new technical building equipment. Many different paths are being taken on the way to climate-neutral houses, and various strategies and claims are circulating. It will be your task to analyses some of them.
Literature research
• Overview of the building stock in Germany
o How did the energy standards for buildings develop in Germany? (WSV, EnEV, EmEG,GEG)
o Define 3 typical building types in Germany that you want to analyse (See e.g. “Dena Gebäudereport 2024”)
• What are the main parameters that influence the COP of Heat pumps?
o How do ASHP and GSHP defer in this context?
• What is Modelica?
o What are the main principles?
o What are the main differences to other modelling tools (like TRANSYS, Simulink, Python…)?
• Get familiar with the test reference year from dwd (see TRY-Handbuch)
Exercise
• Set up Openmodelica (https://openmodelica.org/)
• Find and download the Test reference year (TRY) for Oldenburg (possible add on: and other cities with significantly different weather conditions)
• Download the house model from studip
o Get familiar with the model (Simulate, change parameter)
o Set the parameter for the 3 kind of houses that you choose
o Insert TRY
• Duplicate the model and exchange the ground source Heat Pump by an air source Heat pump
o Check both models with the different TRY provided (2015, 2045, extreme winter, normal winter)
o What are the important parameters of houses for the efficient operation of heat pumps?
o Under what conditions are air-source heat pumps advantageous under what conditions ground source heat pumps?
Requirements
• Enjoy programming and modelling
• Modelica knowledge or willingness to familiarise yourself with Modelica
